Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (instance variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit like a Class.

Abstraction

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.

In other words, the user will have the information on what the object does instead of how it does it.

Inheritance

Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.

Polymorphism

In object-oriented programming, polymorphism (from the Greek meaning “having multiple forms”) is the characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts — specifically, to allow an entity such as a function, or an object to have more than one form.
